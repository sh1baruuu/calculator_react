# Calculator using React

This is a simple calculator web application built using React.

## Getting Started

1. Open the web browser of your choice.
2. Navigate to the following link: https://sh1baruuu.github.io/calculator_react/.
3. You should now see the calculator app in your browser window.

## How to Use

1. Enter the first number in the input field.
2. Select the operation you want to perform from the dropdown.
3. Enter the second number in the input field.
4. Click on the `=` button to see the result.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations are available.
- Basic input validation is in place to prevent non-numeric inputs.
- Division by zero is handled gracefully.
- The clear button resets the inputs and result.

## Dependencies

This project was built using:

- [React](https://react.dev/) (v18.2.0)
- React-DOM (v18.2.0)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (v4.2.0)

## Reflections

   Using Vite was a great choice for this project, as it allowed me to quickly set up a development environment for React. I found the hot module replacement feature to be particularly useful, as it allowed me to see changes to my code in real time without having to manually refresh the page. Overall, I found Vite to be a powerful and efficient tool for building modern web applications, and I look forward to using it in future projects.
